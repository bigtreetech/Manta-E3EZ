# Manta-E3EZ
## Note
With the Manta E3EZ board, we packed it with so many features and connectivity options that we needed to use M2 standoffs instead of M2.5 beneath the CB1 due to the track density. M2 screws will be included with most boards but if you do not receive M2 screws with your board then the specificatons for the correct screw are: M2x10, 4pcs.
